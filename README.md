# nonreagent/dotfiles

Built agent home for **Agent Norton (@nonreagent)** on exe.dev VMs — a curated
subset of [`nonrational/dotfiles`](https://github.com/nonrational/dotfiles) plus
an agent-identity overlay.

## How it works

- `allowlist` (hand-edited — the selection layer) names which upstream paths the
  agent gets; `build.sh` reads each path's target + OS condition from
  `nonrational/dotfiles`'s `manifest` (the placement layer) and materializes it
  into `home/`. A `!path` line subtracts that path from the selection
  (gitignore-style, but exclusions always win — no re-inclusion).
- `build.sh` clones [`nonrational/dotfiles`](https://github.com/nonrational/dotfiles)
  fresh from GitHub, copies that subset into the committed `home/` tree, and
  applies the `@nonreagent` overlay (git identity + `gh` auth, a macOS-free
  `CLAUDE.md`, path-noise silencing, plus `overlay/append/*` blocks appended
  verbatim to same-named vendored files — shell env, tmux). Agent-only skills
  that don't exist upstream live in `overlay/skills/<name>/` and are vendored
  into `home/.agents/skills/`; a name that also exists upstream fails the build,
  so the overlay copy gets deleted rather than silently shadowing it. It runs
  anywhere. It also emits this repo's own `manifest` (generated — do not edit; one row per
  `home/` file) and vendors `deploy.sh`, the shared upstream placement engine.
- `install.sh` (run on the VM) is a thin pre-flight over `deploy.sh apply`,
  which symlinks every file under `home/` into `$HOME`. `~/.claude` stays a
  real directory, so Claude's runtime state never enters the repo, and
  `.config/`/`.codex/` are never touched.

## Build

    ./build.sh            # clones nonrational/dotfiles + overlay -> home/
    ./test/run.sh         # idempotency, secret hygiene, identity, base preservation
    git add home && git commit && git push

By default `build.sh` builds from the pushed state of `nonrational/dotfiles`, so
it reflects what's on GitHub — not uncommitted local edits. To build a local
checkout (the mac edit→build loop), point it at one:

    DOTFILES=~/.dotfiles ./build.sh   # build uncommitted edits

`SOURCE_REPO=<url> ./build.sh` overrides which repo gets cloned.

## Install (on an exe.dev VM)

    git clone https://github.com/nonreagent/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
    gh auth login                 # as @nonreagent
    ~/.claude/sync-plugins.sh     # install enabled Claude plugins

`./deploy.sh audit` reports drift (missing links, edited-in-place files) against
the manifest at any time.

### Review watcher (optional)

Autonomously react to PR reviews on @nonreagent's open PRs. One-time setup on the VM:

    ~/bin/setup-review-watcher     # creates ~/.review-watcher, installs + enables the systemd unit

Observe: `journalctl -u review-watcher -f` · attach reactions: `tmux -S ~/.review-watcher/tmux.sock attach`.
Pause: `touch ~/.review-watcher/PAUSED` or `sudo systemctl stop review-watcher`.
Design + plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-08-review-watcher-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-08-review-watcher.md`.

## Sync

- **Source edits:** push to `nonrational/dotfiles`, then `./build.sh` here picks
  them up. To preview uncommitted edits, `DOTFILES=~/.dotfiles ./build.sh`.
- **VM:** `git pull` (symlinks make it live immediately). Re-run `./install.sh`
  when files were added, moved, or removed — it links new files via `deploy.sh
  apply` and prunes symlinks left dangling by a move/removal. `./deploy.sh
  audit` confirms no drift at any time.
